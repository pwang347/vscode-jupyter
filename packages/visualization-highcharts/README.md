# @dw/visualization-highcharts

This is a component library that implements the visualizations used in DW in a standalone package using the [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) library.

The exported components should be compatible with those from the `@dw/visualization-recharts` package so that the two are interchangeable.
