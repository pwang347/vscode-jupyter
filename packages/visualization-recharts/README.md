# @dw/visualization-recharts

This is a component library that implements the visualizations used in DW in a standalone package using the [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) library.

The exported components should be compatible with those from the `@dw/visualization-highcharts` package so that the two are interchangeable.
